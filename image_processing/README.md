# image_processing_ui_pyqt5  
Image processing UI implemented by PyQt5. The program implements some traditional image processing algorithms including threshold, convolution, morphological algorithms.

### MainWindow:
The mainwindow having several buttons. You can enter the corresponding sub-window by clicking the corresponding button.

### ChildWindow1: Histogram and threshold:  
Requirements：  
  • Program to realize Histogram analysis and threshold operation  
  • Design UI and function buttons  
  • Threshold operation can be manual or automatic (Otsu and Entropy)  

### ChildWindow2:Convolution and Image Filters  
Requirements：  
   • Program to realize the convolution operation and f th t filt one of the next filters  
   • Roberts operator; Prewitt operator; Sobel operator;  
   • Gaussian filter and Median filter  
   • The edge detection and noise reduction  
    
### ChildWindow3:Basic Binary Morphological Algorithm  
Requirements:  
    • Realize binary dilation, erosion,opening and closing operations.  
    • Try to apply fast operations in case  
    
### ChildWindow4:Advanced Binary Morphological Algorithm  
Requirements:  
    • Morphological distance transform  
    • Morphological skeleton
